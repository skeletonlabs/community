## [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

The full Code of conduct can viewed [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

The Skeleton Code of Conduct is shared by all Skeleton Labs repositories and all official community spaces. Any community space that wishes to become official must adopt this Code of Conduct.

Each repository and community space should contain a link back the Code of Conduct in this repository. If you find somewhere that this is not the case then please file an issue in the necessary repository, linking back to this document. Alternatively, feel free to open a Pull Request directly.

The Skeleton Code of Conduct is administered by Skeleton Labs and the community itself. While this is currently a 'good faith' agreement between the leaders of both Skeleton and Skeleton Labs, it is one we take seriously.

This decision was made to both reduce the burden of responsibility on the maintainers as well as holding them accountable. Maintainers typically hold a lot of power and complaints against core member can easily be swept under the rug. Placing the administration and enforcement of the Code of Conduct in the hands of an independent organization will ensure that maintainers are held to the same high standard as any other participant in the Skeleton community.
